# Lesson #: Linked List

## Warm-up (10 minutes)
- Can you recall any basic data structures we’ve used, like arrays or objects?
- How do arrays handle adding or removing elements in the middle? 
- What could be a more flexible alternative to arrays for such operations?

## Written Question (5 minutes)
A linked list is an ordered set of data elements, each containing a link to its successorWhy might a linked list be more useful than an array in certain situations?

**What is a Linked List?**
A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes. Each node contains:
1. **Data** – the value it holds.
2. **Pointer** – a reference to the next node in the sequence.

**Types of Linked Lists**
1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node.
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.
3. **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node.

**Why Use Linked Lists?**
1. Dynamic size: Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically.
2. Efficient insertions/deletions: Adding or removing elements doesn’t require shifting other elements, unlike arrays.

**Class-Based Implementation in JavaScript**
Introduce the idea of creating a linked list using classes.
**Node Class**:
```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```
**LinkedList Class**:
```javascript
class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
  }

  push(data) {
    const newNode = new Node(data);
    if (!this.head) {
      this.head = newNode;
      return;
    }
    let current = this.head;
    while (current.next) {
      current = current.next;
    }
    current.next = newNode;
    this.tail = newNode;
    return this;
  }

  display() {
    let current = this.head;
    while (current) {
      console.log(current.data);
      current = current.next;
    }
  }
}
```
