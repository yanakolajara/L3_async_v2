# Lesson #: Binary Search 

## Warm-up (10 minutes)
To get started, let's refresh our memory on some fundamental concepts:
1. **Array**: A data structure that stores elements in a sequential manner.

2. **Search Algorithm**: A method to find a specific element in an array or other data structure.

3. **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks each element in the array one by one until the desired element is found.

## Written Question (5 minutes)
**Question**: Explain in your own words what a binary search algorithm is and why it is more efficient than a linear search in a sorted array.

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)
**Introduction to Binary Search**
Binary search is a highly efficient search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Unlike linear search, which checks each element one by one, binary search repeatedly divides the search interval in half, making it much faster.

### How Binary Search Works
1. **Initial Setup**: Identify the starting (low) and ending (high) indices of the array.

2. **Calculate Midpoint**: Find the midpoint index (mid) of the current interval.

3. **Comparison**:

- If the target value is equal to the midpoint element, the search is successful.

- If the target value is less than the midpoint element, focus on the left half of the array.

- If the target value is greater than the midpoint element, focus on the right half of the array.

4. **Repeat Steps**: Continue the process until the target value is found or the interval is empty.

**Binary Search in JavaScript**
Here is a simple implementation of binary search in JavaScript:
```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
  let low = 0;
  let high = arr.length - 1;

  while (low <= high) {
    let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);

    if (arr[mid] === target) {
      return mid;
    } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
      low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      high = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  return -1; // Target not found
}
```

**Complexity**
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since it uses constant extra space.

## Problem Solving (35 minutes)
Let's solve some problems to reinforce our understanding.

**Problem 1: Basic Binary Search**
Given a sorted array `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]`, use binary search to find the position of the element `7`.

**Solution**:
1. Set `low = 0` and `high = 6` (length of array - 1).

2. Calculate `mid = Math.floor((0 + 6) / 2) = 3.`

3. Compare `arr[3]` (which is 7) with 7.

4. Since `arr[3]` is equal to `7`, the target value is found at index `3`.

**Problem 2: Target Not Found**
Given a sorted array `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]`, use binary search to find the position of the element `5`.

**Solution:**
1. Set `low = 0` and `high = 5`.

2. Calculate m`id = Math.floor((0 + 5) / 2) = 2`.

3. Compare `arr[2]` (which is `6`) with `5`.

4. Since` 5` is less than `6`, update `high = mid - 1 = 1`.

5. Calculate `mid = Math.floor((0 + 1) / 2) = 0`.

6. Compare `arr[0]` (which is `2`) with `5`.

7. Since `5` is greater than `2`, update `low = mid + 1 = 1`.

8. Calculate `mid = Math.floor((1 + 1) / 2) = 1`.

9. Compare `arr[1]` (which is `4`) with `5`.

10. Since `5` is greater than `4`, update `low = mid + 1 = 2`.

11. Now `low` is greater than `high`, so the target value `5` is not in the array.

## Recap (15 minutes)
Let's recap what we've learned:

1. **Binary Search**: A search algorithm that efficiently finds the position of a target value in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

2. **Implementation**: Key steps include setting the initial low and high indices, calculating the midpoint, and comparing the target value with the midpoint element.

3. **Complexity**: Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n) and a space complexity of O(1).
