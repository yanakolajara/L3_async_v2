# Lesson 11: Understanding Stacks

## Warm-up Written Question (10 minutes)
Explain what is meant by the term "Last In, First Out" (LIFO) in the context of stacks. Provide a real-world analogy.

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

### What is a Stack?
1. Definition and Characteristics
   - LIFO Principle
   - Sequential Data Structure
2. Real-World Examples
   - Stack of plates
   - Browser back button

### Stack Operations
1. Push: Adding an item to the top of the stack
2. Pop: Removing the top item
3. Peek/Top: Viewing the top item without removing it
4. isEmpty: Checking if the stack is empty

### Implementation
- Array-based stacks
- Linked list-based stacks

### Example Use Cases
- Backtracking algorithms (e.g., maze solving)
- Undo operations in text editors
- Expression evaluation (e.g., infix to postfix conversion)

## Problem-Solving Focus
Implementing a stack using arrays and exploring real-world stack applications.
