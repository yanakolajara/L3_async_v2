## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

### Introduction to Two Pointers:

#### What is the Two-Pointer Technique?

- A method used to solve problems involving arrays or linked lists where elements need to be compared in some way, typically to find pairs, compress data, or reverse structures.

#### Types of Two-Pointer Techniques:

- Opposite Direction: Start pointers at opposite ends (e.g., one at the beginning and one at the end of an array) and move them towards each other.
- Same Direction: Both pointers start at the same position and move in the same direction but at different speeds or with different conditions.

#### Advantages:

- Reduces time complexity from O(n²) to O(n) in many cases.
- Decreases the need for additional memory, making it an in-place algorithm.

#### Common Use Cases:

- Pair with a given sum in a sorted array.
- Finding duplicates in an array with all consecutive elements.
- Reversing an array or a linked list.
