# Lesson 31: Intermediate Recursion — Backtracking

## Warm-up (10 minutes)

### Written Question
Backtracking is a technique that builds on recursion to explore multiple potential solutions. In your own words, explain:
1. What backtracking is.
2. How it differs from a simple recursive function.
3. Why it is helpful in solving complex problems like puzzles, mazes, or combinatorial tasks.

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

### 1. Recursion Refresher
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems until it reaches a base case. We typically break a problem down into:
- **Base Case**: A simple scenario where no further recursive calls are needed.
- **Recursive Case**: The function calls itself with smaller or modified data until the base case is reached.

### 2. Introduction to Backtracking
**Backtracking** is a specialized form of recursion that is used to:
- Explore **all possible solutions** or paths in a problem space.
- **“Undo”** (or backtrack) a decision when it leads to a dead end, returning to a previous state to explore another path.

Key points:
1. **Systematic Exploration**: We try a possible move (or choice). If we reach a valid end, we succeed; if not, we **backtrack** by undoing that move and try a different one.
2. **Pruning**: We can often detect invalid paths early and skip exploring them entirely, improving efficiency.
3. **Common Uses**: Maze-solving, N-Queens problem, permutations & combinations, Sudoku, word search puzzles, and more.

### 3. Backtracking Workflow
1. **Choose**: Pick a possibility or make a decision.
2. **Explore**: Recursively solve the next part of the problem.
3. **Check**: If the solution leads to success, great! If it doesn’t:
4. **Backtrack**: Undo the last decision and try another possibility.

### 4. Example: Maze Navigation (Conceptual)
Imagine you’re at the entrance of a maze. You can move up, down, left, or right, but some paths are blocked by walls. With backtracking:
1. You **choose** a direction and step forward.
2. You **explore** deeper in that direction by recursively doing the same checks.
3. If you reach a dead end, you **backtrack** to the last position and try a new direction.

### 5. Advantages and Considerations
- **Advantages**:
  - Straightforward approach to systematically find a valid path (or all valid paths).
  - Works well for complex combinatorial problems where multiple trials are necessary.

- **Considerations**:
  - Potentially high time complexity if many paths exist.
  - Must ensure we detect and avoid revisiting states that lead to loops (e.g., marking visited positions in a maze).

## Problem Solving (35 minutes)
We’ll implement a **backtracking** solution to find a path through a maze. The maze will be represented by a 2D array of `0`s (open paths) and `1`s (walls). The goal is to move from the **top-left corner** `(0,0)` to the **bottom-right corner** `(n-1,m-1)` if a path exists.

## Recap (15 minutes)
1. **Define Backtracking**: A method to explore possible solutions and revert (backtrack) upon failure.
2. **Contrast with Simple Recursion**: Simple recursion tackles a single path until it finishes; backtracking may handle multiple branching paths and revert partial progress.
3. **Where to Use**: Maze-solving, puzzle-solving, generating permutations, search problems, etc.
4. **Optimization**: Use pruning or check constraints early to avoid exploring obviously invalid branches.
