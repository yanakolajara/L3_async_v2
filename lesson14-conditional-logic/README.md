# Lesson 1: Introduction to Conditional Logic

Daily Lesson Structure

## Warm up (10 minutes):

## Written Question (5 minutes):

"Why do we use conditional statements in programming?" Post the question in Slack, have everyone submit their answers simultaneously after a 5-minute timer.

## Topic Overview (20 minutes):

Basic Conditional Statements: Introduce if, else, and else if statements. Explain the syntax and how these statements control program flow based on boolean conditions.

Examples: Show simple examples, like checking if a user is eligible to vote based on age.

## Problem Solving (35 minutes):

Problem Focus: Given the price of a lemonade and the amount a customer pays, determine how much change to give back.
Activities:
Pseudocode: Write pseudocode for handling various payment scenarios (exact amount, more, or less).
Code: Implement the pseudocode in a suitable programming language.
Reflection: Discuss what happens if conditions are not met or are incorrectly implemented.

## Recap (15 minutes):

Review the written quiz question.
Solution Review: Go over the coding solution and discuss different scenarios that were handled.
Feedback Submission: Encourage feedback on the session.
Resources:

Code editor or IDE setup for live coding.
Example snippets and cheat sheets on conditional logic.

### Learning Deliverables:

Understand the basic use of conditional statements.
Apply simple if-else logic to solve a practical problem.
