# Lesson 11: Understanding Stacks

## Warm-up Written Question (10 minutes)

Can you think of any examples from your life where the last thing in was the first thing out? Describe something like this.

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

### What is a Stack?

1. Definition and Characteristics
   - LIFO Principle
   - Sequential Data Structure
2. Real-World Examples
   - Stack of plates
   - Browser back button

### Stack Operations

1. Push: Adding an item to the top of the stack
2. Pop: Removing the top item
3. Peek/Top: Viewing the top item without removing it
4. isEmpty: Checking if the stack is empty

### Implementation

- Array-based stacks
- Linked list-based stacks

### Example Use Cases

- Backtracking algorithms (e.g., maze solving)
- Undo operations in text editors
- Expression evaluation (e.g., infix to postfix conversion)

## Problem-Solving Focus

Implementing a stack using arrays and exploring real-world stack applications.
