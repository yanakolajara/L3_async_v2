# Lesson 12: Stacks Continued

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

### Deep Dive into Stack Applications

#### Balanced Symbols
Learn how stacks are used to determine if parentheses, brackets, and braces in a string are balanced.  
- [Check for Balanced Parentheses (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-for-balanced-parentheses-in-an-expression/)  
- [Parentheses Matching Problem Explained (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZOLb0xHB_Q)

#### Expression Evaluation
Explore how stacks assist in evaluating postfix expressions and converting between infix, prefix, and postfix notation.  
- [Evaluation of Postfix Expression (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-set-4-evaluation-postfix-expression/)  
- [Infix, Prefix, and Postfix Notation (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/crypt/v/infix-prefix-and-postfix-notation)

#### Stack-Based Algorithms
Discover the use of stacks in algorithms like backtracking and depth-first search.  
- [Backtracking Algorithm Explained (FreeCodeCamp)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/backtracking-algorithm/)  
- [Depth First Search Algorithm (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-search-or-dfs-for-a-graph/)

#### Performance Considerations
Understand the time complexity and memory usage of stack operations.  
- [Big O Cheat Sheet: Time Complexity of Stack Operations](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)  
- [Memory Management in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-memory-management/)

#### Real-World Use Cases
Examine practical implementations of stacks, such as undo/redo functionality and XML parsing.  
- [Undo/Redo Implementation with Stacks (Medium)](https://medium.com/swlh/undo-redo-stack-implementation-5d42cde6e7d2)  
- [Check if Tags are Balanced in XML File (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-tags-are-balanced-in-an-xml-file/)


### Real-World Use Cases
- Compilers and interpreters
- Undo/Redo operations
- Parsing nested structures like HTML/XML

## Problem-Solving Focus
Implementing the **Valid Parentheses** problem to solidify stack-based problem-solving skills.
