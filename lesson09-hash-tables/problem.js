 * Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

 * You can return the answer in any order.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - An array of integers.
 * @param {number} target - The target sum.
 * @return {number[]} - An array containing the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
