# Lesson 19: Two Pointers Continued

## Warm-up (10 minutes)

## Written Question (5 minutes)

- Question: Explain in your own words why the two-pointer technique is more efficient than a nested loop approach for solving problems like finding a pair that sums to a specific target in a sorted array.

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

Detailed Explanation of Technique Variations:

Discuss different variations such as the slow-fast pointer technique used in cycle detection in a linked list.
Explain how pointers can be used to implement sliding window techniques for substring problems.
Efficiency and Practicality:

Dive deeper into the computational complexity of using two pointers versus other methods like binary search on certain problems.
Examples where two pointers are the only feasible solution to keep the space complexity minimal.
Advanced Use Cases:

Triplet sum to zero (a variation of two-sum problem but extends to three numbers).
Minimum window substring (an application of the sliding window technique).
